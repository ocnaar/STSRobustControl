# STSRobustControl

Iterative Learning Control (ILC) algorithm to study how the user of a Powered Lower Limb Orthosis (PLLO) could learn to coordinate with a robust finite-horizon LQR driving the torque at the hips of the robot for safely performing a sit-to-stand (STS) movement, regardless of parameter uncertainty, and factors deliberately introduced to hinder learning. The algorithm is published in:
